## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Option 1: Frontend Only (Recommended for Demo)**
This method runs a lightweight, simulated version of the application directly in your browser without needing the backend.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Open the index.html file in your browser
open index.html

# Or, serve it locally using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

```

### **Option 2: Full Stack**
This method runs both the frontend and the Python Flask backend server.

1.  **Backend Setup (Terminal 1)**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 app.py
    ```
    The API server will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Frontend Setup (Terminal 2)**
    ```bash
    cd frontend  
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```
    The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.
